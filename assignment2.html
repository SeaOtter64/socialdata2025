    <h1>Burglary and Justice in San Francisco (2003–2024)</h1>

    <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
    <p>
      This article uses a subset of publicly available crime data from the San Francisco Police Department
      <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>,
      covering burglary incidents between 2003 and 2024. Each entry in the dataset represents a reported burglary case and includes information such as the time and location of the incident, 
      as well as the legal status of the case. A case is marked as <em style="color: green;"><strong>cleared</strong></em> only if the suspect was arrested and successfully prosecuted. 
      Cases that do not meet both criteria are considered <em style="color: red;"><strong>unresolved</strong></em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Burglary Trends and Solving Rates Over Time and by Hour</h2>
    <img src="1.png" alt="Burglary trend and clearance rate over time">
    <p class="caption">
      Figure 1: We analyzed burglary cases by time of day, grouped into two-hour intervals. Green bars indicate solved cases, while red bars represent unsolved ones. The bar chart above shows the corresponding clearance rates across time intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visual analysis of the data shows that burglary cases are primarily concentrated between 17:00 and 01:00. The clearance rate peaks between 17:00 and 19:00, then gradually declines throughout the evening. Notably, both the number of reported cases and the solving rate rise again between 23:00 and 01:00, indicating a secondary peak during late-night hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      This data challenges the common perception that burglaries mainly occur during daytime hours when houses are typically unoccupied.<a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>
      The discrepancy arises from the fact that the dataset reflects the time of reporting rather than the actual time of the incident. As a result, reports filed during daytime or late-night hours often correspond to cases where the burglary was discovered immediately, leading to a higher resolution rate. In contrast, evening reports usually indicate that the crime was discovered upon returning home, and the lower clearance rate can be attributed to the time lag between the incident and the report.
    </p>

    <h2>Spatial Patterns of Burglary and Case Resolution</h2>
    <iframe src="2.html" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    <p class="caption">
      Figure 2: This picture presents a summary of the crime situation in different districts of San Francisco over the past 20 years. 
      To make the impact of the clearance rate more clearly visible, we set the weight of 
      <em style="color: green;"><strong>cleared</strong></em> cases at 0.5, 
      while the weight of <em style="color: red;"><strong>unresolved</strong></em> cases at 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a revised weighted heat map, we can more clearly observe the distribution of burglary cases in different districts of San Francisco. The northern district shows a relatively high crime rate<a href="#ref-3">[3]</a>, coupled with a relatively low arrest rate,
      which strain local law enforcement resources and hinder effective crime resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding Tenderloin, although there have been reports indicating that the overall crime rate in this area is among the highest in all the districts of San Francisco<a href="#ref-4">[4]</a>, when it comes to burglary cases, the number of incidents and the rate of successful resolutions remain the best in this district. This suggests that despite the high overall crime rate, law enforcement efforts in the area may be more effective at resolving burglary cases. Of course, this does not mean that Tenderloin is a sufficiently safe area, and ongoing attention is still required to address other types of crime and improve overall safety.
    </p>

    <h2>Interactive Burglary Timeline</h2>
    <iframe src="3.html" scrolling="yes" style="width: 100%; height: 760px;"></iframe>
    <p class="caption">
      Figure 3: This section employs a visualization technique to compare the effects of resolved and unresolved burglary cases. Each case is represented by a small red circle, with the size of the circle decreasing over time to reflect the diminishing impact of the case. For resolved cases, we assume that the impact is entirely nullified within 30 days, whereas for unresolved cases, the impact gradually fades over a 90-day period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map clearly illustrates that burglary crimes are predominantly concentrated in the northeastern part of San Francisco, particularly within the Central, Southern, and parts of the Tenderloin districts. This concentration can be attributed to the presence of San Francisco's downtown area along the northeastern coast, which, due to its economic vibrancy and urban density, tends to attract a higher number of potential offenders<a href="#ref-5">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Tenderloin area, the visualization clearly demonstrates a high density of burglary incidents and their associated impacts. Despite having a relatively low total number of crimes and a higher crime-solving rate compared to other districts, the small geographical size of Tenderloin means that the impact of these crimes is more pronounced on the average affected level within the area<a href="#ref-6">[6]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the Mission district, although the overall crime rate is not significantly lower than that of the Southern district, the higher arrest rate in this area suggests that the impact of burglary cases is less severe. This indicates that law enforcement efforts may be more effective in addressing crime in this district, reducing the long-term impact on the community.
